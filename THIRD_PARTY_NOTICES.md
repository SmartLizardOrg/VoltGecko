# Third-party notices

VoltGecko application source is licensed under the [MIT License](LICENSE). Third-party components retain their own licenses and copyright notices. The application license does not replace those terms.

## Runtime dependencies

The exact installed versions and declared licenses are recorded in [`package-lock.json`](package-lock.json). Direct runtime dependencies are:

| Component | License | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [React / React DOM](https://github.com/facebook/react) | MIT | Interface |
| [Dexie](https://github.com/dexie/Dexie.js) | Apache-2.0 | Local IndexedDB storage |
| [fflate](https://github.com/101arrowz/fflate) | MIT | Portable project archives |
| [jsPDF](https://github.com/parallax/jsPDF) | MIT | PDF output |
| [Lucide](https://github.com/lucide-icons/lucide) | ISC, with Feather attribution | Interface icons |
| [PDF.js](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js) | Apache-2.0 | PDF floor-plan import |

The build generates `public/THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.txt` from the LICENSE, COPYING and NOTICE files of installed production dependencies, including transitive dependencies. Vite copies this file into `dist/THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.txt` for distribution with the application. `scripts/copy-public-assets.mjs` runs automatically before development and production builds.

PDF.js CMaps, standard fonts and image codecs carry additional notices. `scripts/copy-pdf-assets.mjs` copies their original notice and license files unchanged into `public/pdfjs/` and the build output.

## Fonts and symbols

- Noto Sans: Copyright 2018 The Noto Project Authors, licensed under SIL Open Font License 1.1. The complete notice is in [`public/fonts/OFL.txt`](public/fonts/OFL.txt).
- Original electrical SVG symbols: CC0 1.0 dedication, as described in [`SYMBOLS.md`](SYMBOLS.md). They are not copied from an IEC symbol database and are not IEC-certified.
